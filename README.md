# Gender-Prediction-from-Voice-App
We have predicted gender from Voice using deep learning.

# Introduction
We have a dataset that contains attributes related to voice and using that we are training the machine learning model to predict whether the voice belongs
to a male or female.

In This project, before even starting coding, we will understand about data as it contains some physical attributes through which we are predicting our
final target.

# Models
We will be using SVC and RandomForestClassifier model and train those models using the voice dataset.
